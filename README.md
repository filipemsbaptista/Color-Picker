# Color-Picker

=== DESCRIPTION ===

This is a color picker I created to use in any OpenFrameworks project.
Here I provide an OF project to show how it works. The code is commented and is simple to understand.
You can adapt the code to any project using OF library.

NOTE: Soon I'll try to post the .H and .CPP files for the color picker, so that you can easily port it to your project

=== HOW IT WORKS ===

Just click on whichever rectangle above the color gradient image to select which picker is active (currently, only 2 color pickers are implemented).
Then just click on the color gradient to get the color you want for that picker.

If you have any doubt about the implementation just message me :)
